SudoBOOK
========

This is the SudoRoom Book

Noisebridgers, I am currently in MITERS, an MIT hackerspace. People there let me took away this large robot arm (because its broken). Since I already got a large suitcase and a     backpack, my luggage will probably overweight. Does someone know anybody in Boston that will come to SF shortly? So that I can left some of my personal stuff with him to bring
back to SF later.

If not, I just wear a lot clothes or get rid of some. I will bring the robot arm back !  -Hao
